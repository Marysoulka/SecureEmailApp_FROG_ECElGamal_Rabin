# Secure Email Exchange Application

This project demonstrates a secure email exchange system, integrating **encryption-decryption using FROG in CFB mode**, **secure key delivery with Elliptic Curve El-Gamal**, and **digital signing using the Rabin signature algorithm**. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in email communication.


## Overview

In todayâ€™s digital communication landscape, ensuring data security is paramount. This project combines state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to create a secure email exchange system. By leveraging both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms alongside digital signature verification, it addresses potential vulnerabilities in electronic messaging.

## Features

1. **Symmetric Encryption with FROG in CFB Mode**:
   - Encrypts email messages block by block.
   - Uses an Initialization Vector (IV) to enhance randomness.
   - Ensures data confidentiality and efficient encryption for large datasets.

2. **Asymmetric Encryption with Elliptic Curve El-Gamal**:
   - Provides secure key exchange for symmetric encryption.
   - Uses smaller keys for equivalent security, improving performance.

3. **Digital Signatures with Rabin**:
   - Verifies the authenticity of the sender.
   - Ensures message integrity, preventing unauthorized alterations.


## How It Works
### Message Flow:
1. **Sender (Alice)**:
   - Encrypts the email message using the FROG algorithm in CFB mode.
   - Generates a digital signature for the encrypted message using the Rabin signature algorithm.
   - Encrypts the symmetric encryption key using Elliptic Curve El-Gamal.
   - Sends the encrypted message, encrypted key, public key for EC El-Gamal, and digital signature to the recipient.

2. **Receiver (Bob)**:
   - Verifies the Rabin digital signature to ensure authenticity.
   - Decrypts the symmetric encryption key using EC El-Gamal.
   - Decrypts the email message using the FROG algorithm and the decrypted key.
